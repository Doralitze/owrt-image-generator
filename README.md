# OpenWRT Image generator

This collection of python scripts enable one to compile custom OpenWRT
images at mass. One configures a set of devices with their special
requirements and a set of templates with their special requirements using
YAML. These scripts then build the cartesian product of templates and
devices in order to get you your desired images.
